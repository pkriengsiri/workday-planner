# workday-planner
A simple workday application using HTML, CSS and jQuery

## Description

This application is a single-day fixed-interval day planning tool.  The code was written using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap CSS framework, JavaScript, jQuery libraries, and font-awesome icon toolkit.  The application can be used to record and save tasks to be performed over a standard 9am-5pm workday.

### Features
* Current day displayed in application header
* Discrete time block elements for each hour of the working day
* Editable textareas within each time block to record tasks for the specified time period
* Clickable save buttons which will save the text input by the user to localStorage, allowing it to persist across page refreshes
* Color-coding of time blocks relative to the current hour (past, present and future)
